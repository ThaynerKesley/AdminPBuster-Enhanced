## Description

**AdminPBuster** is a Red Teaming Recon tool to find hidden admin panels on web applications using brute-forcing.  
Instead of bundling a static wordlist and bloating the tool, it **fetches an updated admin panel wordlist** directly from our GitHub repository.

- This keeps the tool **lightweight** and **easy to maintain**.
- Whenever we update the hosted wordlist, **the tool automatically benefits**, without needing to update the script itself.

**Key technical goodies:**
- Multithreaded scanning using curl
- Proper HTTPS and `www.` handling to fix SSL issues
- Real redirect following (`-L` curl flag) bypasses WAFs and Cloudflare protections and log only the valid 200 Responses
- No proxychains/Tor dependency (due to their unreliability for professional offensive operations)
- Optional randomized User-Agent headers (`-ua`) to simulate real traffic

AdminPBuster focuses on **speed**, **reliability**, and **accuracy** while staying very simple to operate going through 10,000+ wordlists.

---

## The Flow Behind It

- **Fetch Updated Wordlist**  
  Downloads the latest `magic_admin_paths.txt` from GitHub automatically.

- **Prepare Target Domain**  
  Adds `www.` if missing, forces HTTPS, solving common SSL and cert mismatch problems.

- **Build and Launch Curl Requests**  
  Constructs lightweight curl calls to quickly test admin paths with correct flags.

- **Multithreaded Scanning**  
  Scans many paths at once using multiple threads to improve speed.

- **Color-Coded Result Parsing**  
  Displays results with colors based on HTTP response codes for easy reading:
  - 200 (OK) in green
  - 301/302 (Redirects) in cyan
  - 403 (Forbidden) in yellow
  - 404 (Not Found) in red
  - Other codes in magenta

- **Log Successful Admin Panels**  
  Admin panels found (200 OK) are automatically saved inside a folder under `results/{target_domain}/found_panels.txt`.

---

## Features

- Lightweight and portable (single Python3 script)
- Automatic admin paths updates from GitHub
- Bypasses Cloudflare and WordPress redirects properly
- Realistic User-Agent randomization with `-ua`
- Multithreaded scanning (default 5 threads, customizable)
- SSL/TLS handling built-in (always uses HTTPS + www)
- Color-coded live scan results
- Only real 200 OK pages saved
- Fancy banners, motivational quotes, rainbow CLI styling, because we love colors!
- Over 10,000+ Wordlists Specifically Aimed for Admin Panel Search

=======
**AdminPBuster-Enhanced** is a fork of [AdminPBuster](https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/AdminPBuster), improved with a **Bug Bounty focus**.  
It adds **custom header injection** and a **global requests-per-second limiter** to adapt the tool for real-world security testing scenarios.

---

## ðŸ”§ New Features in This Fork

- **Custom Headers (`--header`)**  
  Add one or more HTTP headers to each request.  
  Useful for:
  - Testing authenticated endpoints
  - Adding bug bounty identifiers
  - Bypassing filters with custom values  
  Example:
  ```bash
  python3 AdminPBuster.py -t target.com \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN123" \
    --header "X-Intigriti-Username: hunter@intigriti.me"
