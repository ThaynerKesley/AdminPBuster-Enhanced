**AdminPBuster** is written by **Chris "SaintDruG" Abou-Chabke** from **Black Hat Ethical Hacking** and is designed specifically for **Red Teams**, **Offensive Security Experts**, and **Bug Bounty Hunters** looking to discover hidden or obscured admin panels efficiently.

> This fork adds features tailored for **bug bounty workflows**: custom headers, global RPS limiting, and per-request timeoutsâ€”keeping the original spirit, but more flexible for real targets.

## Description

**AdminPBuster** is a Red Teaming Recon tool to find hidden admin panels on web applications using brute-forcing.  
Instead of bundling a static wordlist and bloating the tool, it **fetches an updated admin panel wordlist** directly from our GitHub repository.

- This keeps the tool **lightweight** and **easy to maintain**.
- Whenever we update the hosted wordlist, **the tool automatically benefits**, without needing to update the script itself.

**Key technical goodies:**
- Multithreaded scanning using curl
- Proper HTTPS and `www.` handling to fix SSL issues
- Real redirect following (`-L` curl flag) bypasses WAFs and Cloudflare protections and logs only valid 200 responses
- No proxychains/Tor dependency (due to their unreliability for professional offensive operations)
- Optional randomized User-Agent headers (`-ua`) to simulate real traffic

AdminPBuster focuses on **speed**, **reliability**, and **accuracy** while staying very simple to operate going through 10,000+ wordlists.

## ðŸ”§ Enhancements in This Fork (Bug Bounty Focus)

- **Custom Headers (`--header`)**  
  Add one or more HTTP headers to each request (repeat the flag). Helpful for:  
  - Testing authenticated endpoints (tokens, sessions)  
  - Adding bug bounty identifiers  
  - Trying custom bypass values  

  ```bash
  python3 AdminPBuster.py -t target.com \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN123" \
    --header "X-Intigriti-Username: hunter@intigriti.me"
  ```

* **Global Requests-Per-Second Control (`--rps`)**
  Token-bucket style limiter to control scan pressure and respect program boundaries:

  ```bash
  python3 AdminPBuster.py -t target.com --rps 20
  ```

* **Per-Request Timeout (`--timeout`, default: 5s)**
  Avoid hanging on slow targets:

  ```bash
  python3 AdminPBuster.py -t target.com --timeout 8
  ```
